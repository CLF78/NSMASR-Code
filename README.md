# NSMASR-Code
This repo contains the source code and compiler used in Newer All-Stars. It also contains a bunch of other things, such as the maps and the doodads, the random tiles and animated tiles script, the edited layouts in source form and some other documents. This was uploaded mainly so that i don't fuck up stuff when i need it, but enjoy i guess :P
